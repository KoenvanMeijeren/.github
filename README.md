# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my GitHub profile

My name is Koen van Meijeren and I am a software developer. 
I studied Software Engineering at Windesheim HBO-ICT and I am currently working for Develto in Dronten.

My expertise is in backend work, but I also have experience in front-end work. 
Over the years I have learned and practiced a lot in programming. 
My portfolio contains several school projects I have created over the past few years. 
I also have several hobby projects, in which I practice programming techniques or write frameworks myself (like koenavel or wijdthemuwkunst).
